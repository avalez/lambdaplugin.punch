Lambda Add-On enables user-defined instantly evaluated expressions for issues search. It can be compared to DECODE Oracle/PLSQL Function, or MS Access Expression Builder, but applied to JIRA Issue Fields.

## Install

Just go to Administration - Add Ons - Install in your JIRA, search for 'lambda', see 'Lambda Add-On for JIRA OnDemand' and click install.

When installed Lambda Add-On adds `Decode issue fields` menu item under `Issues` menu. It provides single page to define expressions and apply them to issues search filter.
